% Calculate the tension in each spring. A stretched spring has positive
% tension. Using a linear force rule, with a spring constant of 1. (the
% ratio of the spring constant to the first-order drag coefficient gives
% the timescale, but we don't really care about the timescale)
function T = get_spring_tensions(current_length,neutral_length)

	%T = (current_length-neutral_length);        % Jordan
	T = log((current_length./neutral_length)); % Kavrayskiy
